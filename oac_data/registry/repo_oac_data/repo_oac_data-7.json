Through their firsthand documents, photos, and recordings, this digital collection provides a unique view into Santa Clara County\u2019s incredible past through the eyes the elected officials chosen to lead the region.\r\nIn 2011, County Supervisor Dave Cortese created the County Archives Taskforce comprised of former County Supervisors. The Taskforce created a pilot website.\r\nThis interactive digital collection builds on that work, providing an expanded database of thousands of firsthand documents, photos, videos, and other multimedia. A work in constant progress, the size of the collection will continue to grow as more materials are processed. \r\nWe hope you enjoy this peek into the work of former Santa Clara County Supervisors and the notable policies and initiatives they championed.\r\nThe contents of this site are intended for educational purposes only.
