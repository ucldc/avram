Three distinct eras are represented in the site's museum collection. Owens Valley Paiute inhabiting the area from A.D. 600 to the early 1900s; the early ranching and farming period from 1860-1930; and the World War II confinement of Japanese Americans from 1942-1945. The National Park Service has conducted oral histories about these eras of Manzanar since 1999. The purpose of the collection is to preserve, study and interpret the cultural history of Manzanar.Bird pins are one of many artifacts in the Manzanar Collection. These and other items offer a glimpse into life in camp. Furniture, clothing, utensils, cemetery offerings, and other tangible resources enrich our knowledge and our ability to tell the stories of people who lived at Manzanar.",

        "description": "James W. Marshall discovered gold in 1848 on the South Fork of the American River in the valley the Nisenan Indians knew as Cullumah. This event led to the greatest mass movement of people in the Western Hemisphere and was the spark that ignited the spectacular growth of the West during the ensuing decades. The gold discovery site, now Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park, located in the still visible tailrace of Sutter's sawmill, in present day Coloma California, is one of the most significant historic sites in the nation. \r\n \r\nJames W. Marshall found shining flecks of gold in the tailrace of the sawmill he was building for himself and John Sutter. This discovery in 1848 changed the course of California's and the nation's history. See a replica of the original sawmill and over 20 historic buildings including mining, house, school, and store exhibits. \r\n \r\nVisitors have the opportunity to try panning for gold in the American River and enjoy hikes and picnics under the riparian oak woodlands. Overlooking the beautiful river canyon, where the gold discoverer rests today, see California's first historic monument, the statue of James Marshall pointing at his gold discovery site. \r\n \r\nCome participate in tours or special events, see exhibits and \"Living History Days\" planned regularly throughout the year; contact the Gold Discovery Museum and Visitor Center for details. Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park is proud to now offer the Eureka Experience school and group programs, and gold panning lessons for park visitors.",

        "description": "The Pacifica Radio Archives is one of the oldest and largest collections of non-commercial listener-sponsored public radio programs in world. Chronicling the political, cultural and artistic movements of the second half of the 20th century, Pacifica radio programs include documentaries, performances, discussions, debates, drama, poetry readings, commentaries and radio arts. The Pacifica Radio Archives appraise, collect, organize, describe, and preserve the creative work generated by, or produced in association with, Pacifica Radio, and make it available for research and reference use.\r\n\r\nThe Archives is delighted to be a part of the California Audiovisual Preservation Project (CAVPP). The two oldest Pacifica Radio sister stations, KPFA-FM and KPFK-FM, are based in Berkeley and Los Angeles, respectively. Over the past sixty years, KPFA and KPFK have borne witness to events in both Northern and Southern California, and have prominently featured the voices of California denizens and community members who were often excluded from both local and national news media. The Archives' CAVPP collection features actuality from mass demonstrations such as People's Park Protest and the International Hotel evictions; incisive public affairs programming about issues that affected Californians of the time, such as the passage of Proposition 13, farm workers' strikes, and racial segregation in urban communities; interviews with politicians, artists and countercultural figures; and much more. Many of these recordings have not been heard since their initial broadcast on Pacifica airwaves.",

        "description": "The Sierra Club has maintained a library since its beginnings more than a century ago. The Club's first library was based on a small collection of mountaineering literature that served John Muir and other mountaineers at the turn of the twentieth century. In San Francisco's devastating 1906 earthquake and fire, this early collection was destroyed, but the library was soon reestablished through an outpouring of donations. From those small beginnings the library has grown to accommodate the evolving needs of Sierra Club members. As the Club grew, so did its library. It now holds a significant conservation and mountaineering collection. In 1965, the Library was dedicated as a memorial to William E. Colby , the first secretary of the Sierra Club and a director for forty-nine years. As a reference library, ours is a non-circulating, research collection. Sierra Club members and the public are welcome to use the library as visitors, by appointment. In our reading room at the Club's San Francisco headquarters, we provide on-site access to our extensive collection of books, periodicals, mountaineering journals, government documents, historic photographs, slides, maps and memorabilia. Researchers who are unable to visit our library may search the online catalog  for our traditional collections. We respond to reference inquiries regarding Sierra Club publications and history, and will provide photocopies of specific articles if needed. In the 21st century, the Colby Library has expanded online. Our mission is to bring more great content from the Club's website to the library's holdings.",

A majority of the collection contains recorded oral interviews with people who personally knew John Steinbeck and are recounting their memories with him. Other material includes film from the Steinbeck Festival XIII in 1995.\r\n\r\nThe Salinas Public Library has proudly served the community since 1909 when it first opened its doors as a Carnegie Public Library. Today, there are three branch libraries, John Steinbeck Library, Cesar Chavez Library, and El Gabilan Library, with services available 7-days a week. The collection includes more than 100,000 books, magazines, movies, and audiobooks, and a separate Steinbeck Collection of more than a thousand books, articles, and historical items.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, the library was featured in the movie \u201cThe Hollywood Librarian\u201d after it received national attention for nearly closing its doors because of severe budget cuts. Rally Salinas, a local and regional effort to restore funding for the library through a local tax measure, was ultimately successful in sustaining operations. Today, the Salinas Public Library is experiencing a renaissance of programs and services with its recent launch of a Digital Branch that includes an extensive collection of online resources, databases, instructional software, as well as eBooks, eMagazines, streaming movies, and much more.\r\n",
