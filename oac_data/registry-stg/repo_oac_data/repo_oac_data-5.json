The \"Highway Recollections\" series consists of tape recordings and published transcriptions of interviews with retired engineers, highway maintenance workers, administrators, and other personnel who have shared their insights on past highway development and changes within the Department. All available recordings in this series have been digitized and are available via streaming. \r\n\r\nIn the wake of the October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake, Caltrans commissioned an oral history project to document the personal and professional experiences of 258 Caltrans employees who worked to restore the State's damaged transportation system. Caltrans staff in District 4 initiated the \u201cLoma Prieta\u201d project. It was organized quickly and informally with interviews completed within three months of the earthquake while their memories were fresh. The interviews cover a cross section of job titles and geographic areas to better illustrate the size and scope of the disaster. \r\n\r\nCurrently, only a small portion of the original 258 interviews have been digitalized, but Caltrans library currently is working in partnership with the California Audiovisual Preservation Project (CAVPP) to digitalize all the recordings.

        "description": "Founded in 1983, the Women's Museum of California is one of five women's museums in the United States.  The museum's mission is to educate and inspire current and future generations about the experiences and contributions of women by collecting, preserving, and interpreting the documentary and visual evidence of those experiences.  The museum aims to provide the community a broad collection of reference materials that document women\u2019s history and the female experience.  \r\n\r\nWith approximately 4,000 works in the Library Collection, the interdisciplinary nature concerning women\u2019s history is reflected in our holdings - offering resources on a wide variety of disciplines such as women in the arts, women\u2019s health & reproductive rights, women in the military, biographical works, LGBT studies, law & politics, and seminal works on the first and second waves of the feminist movement.  The majority of the Library Collection is comprised of printed works including books, journals, and periodicals. A small collection of audio-visual materials are available, including early sound recordings (vinyl) and our oral history collection that includes interviews from prominent women in the Unitarian Universalist Church and San Diego\u2019s Hall of Fame Inductees.\r\n\r\nThe Women\u2019s Museum of California also houses a historically significant Special Collection containing rare and out-of-print volumes dating from the mid-1800s.  A prized collection is a first edition set of Susan B. Anthony\u2019s and Ida Husted Harper\u2019s \u201cThe History of Women\u2019s Suffrage,\u201d the only known first edition to exist in California. \r\n\r\nThe Women's Museum of California's Archival Collection houses nearly 300 linear feet of material documenting the life and work of prominent female leaders and organizations' commitment to women's rights and representation.  The Archival Collection includes the first women\u2019s studies program developed at San Diego State University, collections from U.N. Conferences on the Status of Women, the National Organization for Women (N.O.W.), the Older Women\u2019s League (O.W.L.), California Women for Agriculture, Women\u2019s International League for Peace and Freedom (W.I.L.P.F.), National League of American Pen Women, League of Women Voters, National Women\u2019s Political Caucus, the American Association of University Women, and finally Planned Parenthood and the Women\u2019s Care Clinic of San Diego.  The personal papers and archival collections of prominent women include our founder, Mary Maschal; California suffragist sympathizer, Alice Park; Nancy Reeves; former California Senator, Lucy Killea; and Alice Barnes.",
