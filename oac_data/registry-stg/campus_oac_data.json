        "description": "The University of California, Berkeley is home to many valuable collections of non-book artifacts and objects housed in campus museums, libraries, and archives. Managing, conserving, and providing access to these collections is an important contribution to the fulfillment of the University's research, teaching, and public service missions. These collections, including those that increasingly feature digitized materials, document the cultural, biological and physical diversity of California and many other regions and cultures of the world. The collections support research and teaching in many disciplines across campus, from Art to Zoology. The collections are large and diverse in content and many are among the premier collections of their kind in the world.",
