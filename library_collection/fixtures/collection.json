The project was carried out in 1999-2000 with support from the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services under the provisions of the Library Services and Technology Act, administered in California by the State Librarian.

In the last third of this century, people with disabilities, most of whom had no history of political involvement, have organized and acted to change the conditions of their own lives. It is this period of historic change that is being documented here in the Disability Rights Independent Living Movement [DRILM] national research and documentation project.",

The collection focuses on pictorial interpretations of the old West, with emphasis on the early California and Gold Rush periods. Views depict the changing landscape of the West under the impact of westward migration, the development of towns and cities, early settlements, California missions, railroads, gold mining scenes, pioneer and frontier life, native populations, social history, and many other topics. Many items in the collection are of unique historical value as they represent some of the earliest records of a particular scene, location, or event. Included are the earliest known views of the Presidio of Monterey, Mission Carmel, San Francisco, and Yosemite. Geographically, the collection focuses primarily on California, but also includes images from the Pacific Northwest, other Northern American states, South and Central America, Oceania, Europe, Russia, and other locations. The entire collection covers from ca.1790 through the early 1930s, with the bulk of works dating between 1850 and the 1870s.",

Many of the collections have distinctive histories of their own. In some cases entire collections have been included; more often a selection of materials relating to the Chinese in California has been selected from a collection with broader scope. It is our hope that The Chinese in California presents a balanced perspective on a tumultuous and changing history of this community in California. Major issues explored in these records include the Chinese contribution to California and the American West in the 19th and early 20th centuries; the rampant anti-Chinese sentiment encountered by these immigrants, eventually leading to the federal Chinese Exclusion Act of 1892 (repealed in 1943); and settlement and development in various communities, including San Francisco's Chinatown, which remains the largest Chinatown in the United States. The materials presented in The Chinese in California are only a small part of the wealth of historical and archival materials documenting this topic at participating institutions. Users should note the source of the materials found on this site and contact the holding libraries or archives for further information.",
