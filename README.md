# Collection Registry

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ucldc/avram.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ucldc/avram)

Playing around with a django app for managing a registry of UC Libraries
Digital Collections.

## Installation

### Clone repo:

```sh
cd ~/Projects       # or wherever you like to put source code
git clone git@github.com:ucldc/avram.git
```

### Make sure you're running Python 3.7.16:

Install pyenv https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv, then run 

```sh
cd ~/Projects/avram     # or wherever you cloned this repo
python --version        # should be Python 3.7.16, if not:
pyenv install 3.7.16
pyenv rehash
python --version        # should be Python 3.7.16
pyenv version-origin    # should be avram/.python-version
```

### Create virtual environment and install Avram requirements

```sh
cd ~/Projects/avram
python3 -m venv ~/.envs/registry
source ~/.envs/registry/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install Exhibit Application
The exhibit app code can be placed anywhere, as long as a link is established from `exhibitapp/exhibits/` to `avram/exhibits/`, here I've put the avram and exhibitapp folders next to each other. 

```sh
cd ~/Projects
git clone git@github.com:ucldc/exhibitapp.git
cd exhibitapp
pip install -r requirements.txt
brew install libmagic           # https://pypi.org/project/python-magic/
cd ../avram
ln -s ../exhibitapp/exhibits/
cp env.local.in env.local
```

Modify env.local with solr connection details then:
```sh
source env.local
```

### Install Publishing Projects Application
The publishing projects app code can be placed anywhere, as long as a link is established from `publishing_projects/` to `avram/publishing_projects`, here I've put the avram and publishing_project folders next to each other.

```sh
cd ~Projects
git clone git@github.com:ucldc/publishing_projects.git
cd avram
ln -s ../publishing_projects
```

### Install OAI Application
The OAI app code can be placed anywhere, as long as a link is established from `oaiapp/oai` to `avram/oai`, here I've put the avram and oai folders next to each other.

```sh
cd ~Projects
git clone git@github.com:ucldc/oaiapp.git
cd avram
ln -s ../oaiapp/oai
```

### [Optional] Using msyql? add:

```sh
pip install MySQL-python==1.2.4
```

## Data Setup

### Create the database: 
```sh
python manage.py migrate
```

### Dump data from a production instance:
```sh
python manage.py dumpdata library_collection -a --format=json --indent=2 --natural-foreign --natural-primary -o library_collection.json

python manage.py dumpdata exhibits -a --format=json --indent=2 --natural-foreign --natural-primary -o exhibits.json

python manage.py dumpdata oai -a --format=json --indent=2 --natural-foreign --natural-primary -o oai.json

python manage.py dumpdata publishing_projects -a --format=json --indent=2 --natural-foreign --natural-primary -o publishing_projects.json
```

scp it to your local machine

### Load data
```sh
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/library_collection.json
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/exhibits.json
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/publishing_projects.json
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/oai.json
```

### Load static files
```sh
python manage.py collectstatic
```

### Create super user
```sh
python manage.py createsuperuser --settings=collection_registry.test_settings
```

### Run dev server
```sh
python manage.py runserver --settings=collection_registry.test_settings
```

## Test:
The remoteuser shibboleth login won't work when testing. Use the collection_registry.test_settings module for testing, it adds the typical Django authentication module to the AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS list.

```
python manage.py test --settings=collection_registry.test_settings  library_collection
```
