# Collection Registry

Playing around with a django app for managing a registry of UC Libraries
Digital Collections.

## notes

```
virtualenv --no-site-packages .
source bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt --use-mirrors
```

## load

via `fixtures/initial_data.json` and loading individual fixtures

```
python manage.py syncdb
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py loaddata library_collection/fixtures/collection.json
python manage.py collectstatic

```

## Test:
The remoteuser shibboleth login won't work when testing. Use the collection_registry.test_settings module for testing, it adds the typical Django authentication module to the AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS list.

```
python manage.py test --settings=collection_registry.test_settings  library_collection
```
